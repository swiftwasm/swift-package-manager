## 1. Notations

The following terminology and conventions are used in this document.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
as described in [RFC 5234]
and Unicode regular expression syntax
as described in [Unicode Technical Standard #18][UAX18].

API endpoints that accept parameters in their path
are expressed by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) templates,
as described in [RFC 6570].

## 2. Definitions

The following terms, as used in this document, have the meanings indicated.

- _Package_:
  A named collection of Swift source code
  that is organized into one or more modules
  according to a `Package.swift` manifest file.
- _Scope_:
  A logical grouping of related packages assigned by a package registry.
- _Release_:
  The state of a package after applying a particular set of changes
  that is uniquely identified by an assigned version number.
- _Version Number_:
  An identifier for a package release
  in accordance with the [Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)][SemVer].

## 3. Conventions

This document uses the following conventions
in its description of client-server interactions.

### 3.1. Application layer protocols

A client and server MUST communicate over a secured connection
using Transport Layer Security (TLS) with the `https` URI scheme.

The use of HTTP 1.1 in examples is non-normative.
A client and server MAY communicate according to this specification
using any version of the HTTP protocol.

### 3.2. Authentication

A server MAY require authentication
for client requests to access information about packages and package releases.

A server SHOULD respond with a status code of `401` (Unauthorized)
if a client sends a request to an endpoint that requires authentication
without providing credentials.
A server MAY respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found) or `403` (Forbidden)
when a client provides valid credentials
but isn't authorized to access the requested resource.

A server MAY use any authentication model of its choosing.
However, the use of a scoped, revocable authorization framework
like [OAuth 2.0][RFC 6749] is RECOMMENDED.

### 3.3. Error handling

A server SHOULD communicate any errors to the client
using "problem details" objects,
as described by [RFC 7807].
For example,
a client sends a request to create a package release
with an invalid `tag` parameter
and receives the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "tag '2.0.0' not found"
}
```

### 3.4. Rate limiting

A server MAY limit the number of requests made by a client
by responding with a status code of `429` (Too Many Requests).

```http
HTTP/1.1 429
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en
Retry-After: 60

{
   "detail": "try again in 60 seconds"
}
```

A client SHOULD follow the guidance of any
`Retry-After` header values provided in responses
to prevent overwhelming a server with retry requests.
It is RECOMMENDED for clients to introduce randomness in their retry logic
to avoid a [thundering herd effect].

### 3.5. API versioning

Package registry APIs are versioned.

API version numbers are designated by decimal integers.
The accepted version of this proposal constitutes the initial version, `1`.
Subsequent revisions SHOULD be numbered sequentially
(`2`, `3`, and so on).

API version numbers SHOULD follow
Semantic Versioning conventions for major releases.
Non-breaking changes, such as
adding new endpoints,
adding new optional parameters to existing endpoints,
or adding new information to existing endpoints in a backward-compatible way,
SHOULD NOT require a new version.
Breaking changes, such as
removing or changing an existing endpoint
in a backward-incompatible way,
MUST correspond to a new version.

A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header field
to specify the API version of a request.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/list HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
```

Valid `Accept` header field values are described by the following rules:

```abnf
    version     = "1"       ; The API version
    mediatype   = "json" /  ; JSON (default media type)
                  "zip"  /  ; Zip archives, used for package releases
                  "swift"   ; Swift file, used for package manifest
    accept      = "application/vnd.swift.registry" [".v" version] ["+" mediatype]
```

A server SHALL set the `Content-Type` and `Content-Version` header fields
with the corresponding content type and API version number of the response.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1
```

If a client sends a request without an `Accept` header,
a server MAY either return `400 Bad Request` or
process the request using an API version that it chooses,
making sure to set the `Content-Type` and `Content-Version` headers accordingly.

If a client sends a request with an `Accept` header
that specifies an unknown or invalid API version,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `400` (Bad Request).

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "invalid API version"
}
```

If a client sends a request with an `Accept` header
that specifies a valid but unsupported API version,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `415` (Unsupported Media Type).

```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "unsupported API version"
}
```

### 3.6. Package identification

A package may declare external packages as dependencies in its manifest.
Each package dependency may specify a requirement
on which versions are allowed.

An external package dependency may itself have
one or more external package dependencies,
known as <dfn>transitive dependencies</dfn>.
When multiple packages have dependencies in common,
Swift Package Manager determines which version of that package should be used
(if any exist that satisfy all specified requirements)
in a process called <dfn>package resolution</dfn>.

Each external package is uniquely identified
by a scoped identifier in the form `scope.package-name`.

#### 3.6.1 Package scope

A *scope* provides a namespace for related packages within a package registry.
A package scope consists of alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
Hyphens may not occur at the beginning or end,
nor consecutively within a scope.
The maximum length of a package scope is 39 characters.
A valid package scope matches the following regular expression pattern:

```regexp
\A[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9]|-(?=[a-zA-Z0-9])){0,38}\z
```

Package scopes are case-insensitive
(for example, `mona` ≍ `MONA`).

#### 3.6.2 Package name

A package's *name* uniquely identifies a package in a scope.
The maximum length of a package name is 128 characters.
A valid package name matches the following regular expression pattern:

```regexp
\A\p{XID_Start}\p{XID_Continue}{0,127}\z
```

> For more information,
> see [Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax][UAX31].

Package names are compared using
[Normalization Form Compatible Composition (NFKC)][UAX15]
with locale-independent case folding.

## 4. Endpoints

A server MUST respond to the following endpoints:

| Link                 | Method | Path                                                      | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [\[1\]](#endpoint-1) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}`                                         | List package releases                           |
| [\[2\]](#endpoint-2) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}`                               | Fetch metadata for a package release            |
| [\[3\]](#endpoint-3) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}/Package.swift{?swift-version}` | Fetch manifest for a package release            |
| [\[4\]](#endpoint-4) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}.zip`                           | Download source archive for a package release   |
| [\[5\]](#endpoint-5) | `GET`  | `/identifiers{?url}`                                      | Lookup package identifiers registered for a URL |

A server SHOULD also respond to `HEAD` requests
for each of the specified endpoints.

* * *

<a name="endpoint-1"></a>

### 4.1. List package releases

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/{scope}/{name}`
to retrieve a list of the available releases for a particular package.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with
the `application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json` content type
and MAY append the `.json` extension to the requested URI.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
```

If a package is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/json`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

A server SHOULD respond with a JSON document
containing the releases for the requested package.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1
Link: <https://github.com/mona/LinkedList>; rel="canonical",
      <ssh://git@github.com:mona/LinkedList.git>; rel="alternate",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1>; rel="latest-version",
      <https://github.com/sponsors/mona>; rel="payment"

{
    "releases": {
        "1.1.1": {
            "url": "https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1"
        },
        "1.1.0": {
            "url": "https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.0",
            "problem": {
                "status": 410,
                "title": "Gone",
                "detail": "this release was removed from the registry"
            }
        },
        "1.0.0": {
            "url": "https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.0.0"
        }
    }
}
```

The response body SHALL contain a JSON object
nested at a top-level `releases` key,
whose keys are version numbers for releases and
whose values are objects containing the following fields:

| Key       | Type   | Description                           | Requirement Level |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `url`     | String | The location of the release resource. | REQUIRED          |
| `problem` | Object | A [problem details][RFC 7807] object. | OPTIONAL          |

A server SHOULD communicate the unavailability of a package release
using a ["problem details"][RFC 7807] object.
A client SHOULD consider any releases with an associated `problem`
to be unavailable for the purposes of package resolution.

A server SHOULD respond with
a link to the latest published release of the package if one exists,
using a `Link` header field with a `latest-version` relation.

A server SHOULD list releases in order of precedence,
starting with the latest version.
However, a client SHOULD NOT assume
any specific ordering of versions in a response.

A server MAY include a `Link` entry
with the `canonical` relation type
that locates the source repository of the package.

A server MAY include one or more `Link` entries
with the `alternate` relation type
for other source repository locations.

A server MAY paginate results by responding with
a `Link` header field that includes any of the following relations:

| Name    | Description                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `next`  | The immediate next page of results.     |
| `last`  | The last page of results.               |
| `first` | The first page of results.              |
| `prev`  | The immediate previous page of results. |

For example,
the `Link` header field in a response for the third page of paginated results:

```http
Link: <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap/5.0.3>; rel="latest-version",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=1>; rel="first",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=2>; rel="previous",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=4>; rel="next",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=10>; rel="last"
```

A server MAY respond with additional `Link` entries,
such as one with a `payment` relation for sponsoring a package maintainer.

<a name="endpoint-2"></a>

### 4.2. Fetch metadata for a package release

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/{scope}/{name}/{version}`
to retrieve metadata about a release.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with
the `application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json` content type,
and MAY append the `.json` extension to the requested URI.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1 HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
```

If a release is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/json`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1
Link: <https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1>; rel="latest-version",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.0.0>; rel="predecessor-version"
```

A server SHOULD respond with a `Link` header containing the following entries:

| Relation              | Description                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest-version`      | The latest published release of the package                    |
| `successor-version`   | The next published release of the package, if one exists       |
| `predecessor-version` | The previously published release of the package, if one exists |

A link with the `latest-version` relation
MAY correspond to the requested release.

#### 4.2.1. Package release metadata standards

A server MAY include metadata fields in its package release response.
It is RECOMMENDED that package metadata be represented in [JSON-LD]
according to a structured data standard.
For example,
this response using the [Schema.org] [SoftwareSourceCode] vocabulary:

```jsonc
{
  "@context": ["http://schema.org/"],
  "@type": "SoftwareSourceCode",
  "name": "LinkedList",
  "description": "One thing links to another.",
  "keywords": ["data-structure", "collection"],
  "version": "1.1.1",
  "codeRepository": "https://github.com/mona/LinkedList",
  "license": "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0",
  "programmingLanguage": {
    "@type": "ComputerLanguage",
    "name": "Swift",
    "url": "https://swift.org"
  },
  "author": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "@id": "https://example.com/mona",
      "givenName": "Mona",
      "middleName": "Lisa",
      "familyName": "Octocat"
  }
}
```

<a name="endpoint-3"></a>

### 4.3. Fetch manifest for a package release

A client MAY send a `GET` request for a URI matching the expression
`/{scope}/{name}/{version}/Package.swift`
to retrieve the package manifest for a release.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header to
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+swift`.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+swift
```

If a release is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `text/x-swift`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: text/x-swift
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Package.swift"
Content-Length: 361
Content-Version: 1
ETag: 87e749848e0fc4cfc509e4090ca37773
Link: <http://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/Package.swift?swift-version=4>; rel="alternate",
      <http://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/Package.swift?swift-version=4.2>; rel="alternate"

// swift-tools-version:5.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "LinkedList",
    products: [
        .library(name: "LinkedList", targets: ["LinkedList"])
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "LinkedList"),
        .testTarget(name: "LinkedListTests", dependencies: ["LinkedList"]),
    ],
    swiftLanguageVersions: [.v4, .v5]
)
```

A server SHOULD respond with a `Content-Length` header
set to the size of the manifest in bytes.

A server SHOULD respond with a `Content-Disposition` header
set to `attachment` with a `filename` parameter equal to
the name of the manifest file
(for example, "Package.swift").

It is RECOMMENDED for clients and servers to support
caching as described by [RFC 7234].

A server SHOULD include `Link` header fields with the `alternate` relation type
for each additional file in the release's source archive
whose filename matches the following regular expression pattern:

```regexp
\APackage(?:@swift-\d+(?:\.\d+){0,2})?.swift\z
```

#### 4.3.1. swift-version query parameter

A client MAY specify a `swift-version` query parameter
to request a manifest for a particular version of Swift.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift?swift-version=4.2 HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+swift
```

If the package includes a file named
`Package@swift-{swift-version}.swift`,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the content of that file in the response body.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: text/x-swift
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Package@swift-4.2.swift"
Content-Length: 361
Content-Version: 1
ETag: 24f6cd72352c4201df22a5be356d4d22

// swift-tools-version:4.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "LinkedList",
    products: [
        .library(name: "LinkedList", targets: ["LinkedList"])
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "LinkedList"),
        .testTarget(name: "LinkedListTests", dependencies: ["LinkedList"]),
    ],
    swiftLanguageVersions: [.v3, .v4]
)
```

Otherwise,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `303` (See Other)
and redirect to the unqualified `Package.swift` resource.

```http
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Content-Version: 1
Location: https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift
```

<a name="endpoint-4"></a>

### 4.4. Fetch source archive

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/{scope}/{name}/{version}`
to retrieve a release's source archive.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header to
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+zip`
and SHOULD append the `.zip` extension to the requested path.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1.zip HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+zip
```

If a release is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/zip`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="LinkedList-1.1.1.zip"
Content-Length: 2048
Content-Version: 1
Digest: sha-256=a2ac54cf25fbc1ad0028f03f0aa4b96833b83bb05a14e510892bb27dea4dc812
ETag: e61befdd5056d4b8bafa71c5bbb41d71
Link: <https://mirror-japanwest.example.com/mona-LinkedList-1.1.1.zip>; rel=duplicate; geo=jp; pri=10; type="application/zip"
```

A server SHALL respond with a `Content-Length` header
set to the size of the archive in bytes.
A client SHOULD terminate any requests whose response exceeds
the expected content length.

A server SHALL respond with a `Digest` header
containing a SHA-256 checksum for the source archive.

A server SHOULD respond with a `Content-Disposition` header
set to `attachment` with a `filename` parameter equal to the name of the package
followed by a hyphen (`-`), the version number, and file extension
(for example, "LinkedList-1.1.1.zip").

It is RECOMMENDED for clients and servers to support
range requests as described by [RFC 7233]
and caching as described by [RFC 7234].

#### 4.4.1. Integrity verification

A client SHOULD verify the integrity of a downloaded source archive
using the checksum provided in the `Digest` header of a response
(for example, using the command
`echo "$CHECKSUM LinkedList-1.1.1.zip" | shasum -a 256 -c`).

#### 4.4.2. Download locations

A server MAY specify mirrors or multiple download locations
using `Link` header fields
with a `duplicate` relation,
as described by [RFC 6249].
A client MAY use this information
to determine its preferred strategy for downloading.

A server that indexes but doesn't host packages
SHOULD respond with a status code of `303` (See Other)
and redirect to a hosted package archive if one is available.

```http
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Content-Version: 1
Location: https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1.zip
```

<a name="endpoint-5"></a>

### 4.5 Lookup package identifiers registered for a URL

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/identifiers{?url}`
to retrieve package identifiers associated with a particular URL.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header to
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json`.

```http
GET /identifiers?url=https://github.com/mona/LinkedList HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1
```

If one or more package identifiers are associated with the specified URL,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/json`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

A server SHOULD respond with a JSON document
containing the package identifiers for the specified URL.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1

{
    "identifiers": [
      "mona.LinkedList"
    ]
}
```

The response body SHALL contain an array of package identifier strings
nested at a top-level `identifiers` key.

It is RECOMMENDED for clients and servers to support
caching as described by [RFC 7234].
